# 21minigame-renpy
 A dice minigame similar to 21 (blackjack) for Ren'Py

This text-based minigame is a dice version of the popular card game 21/Blackjack.
It's much simpler and way more player friendly, the return to the player (RTP) is around 121%, meaning that in theory, if you play 100 credits, you will average 21.1 in credits winnings.

You can modify the conditions if you want to make the game harder or easier for the player.

This is intended to be used in Ren'Py, you can save this file in the same directory as your script.rpy and call it with "jump minigame" in your main script.

Feel free to modify and do whatever.

To-do: Implement a graphic interface
